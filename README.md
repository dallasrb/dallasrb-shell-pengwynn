# Craft your own IDE in the shell

# I love TEXT MODE _

# That wasn't always true.

# A long time ago in a cubicle far, far away.

# ASP.NET by Example

# ASP.NET Custom Controls

# I later left .NET, because reasons.

# __VIEWSTATE__

# :trollface:

# rails new pivot

# A new platform brought new tools.

# TextMate

# MySQL workbench

# script/generate (Terminal.app)

# script/console (Terminal.app)

# script/server (Terminal.app)

# tail -f development.log (Terminal.app)

   Tie all those together and show _per project_

 x 3 or 4 concurrent client apps

# Thinking back this seems like major friction

# But at the time, I was still happy because Ruby makes me happy.

# A new platform brought new friends.

# Them: Y U NO VIM ?

# Me: Um, I don't know, Y U SHOUT?

# (tweet from I am devlopr)

# And later

# Y U NO COMPASS

# Me: Because I've never heard of it?

# Protip: Y U NO is the worst form of evangelism.

# My journey into the shell:

# The Changelog: Episode 0.5.6

# I asked some Vim experts why they <3 Vim

# Like Rails, I set out to disprove the hype

# MacVim

# Solarized

# All of my tools in the shell or browser.

# I could work from anywhere.

# Joy++

# Then I discovered tmux

# A terminal multiplexer

# I could now craft my IDE in the shell

# Craft - definition
# Your own - personalized
# IDE
## Integrated - with various parts or aspects linked or coordinated.
## Development - yup
## Environment - the surroundings or conditions in which a person, animal, or plant lives or operates.

# Build your own lightsaber, yo
